These numbers are pretty wacky, indicating an extremely over-powered situation. I've never seen drag coefficient exceed lift ratio before.

More reasonable. It has a lot of elevator authority, but then the real think probably did as well.

Slight decrease in approach AoA yields better solver results.

I greatly increased the signficance of these drag bodies by changing width from 0.01 to 0.5. The original values just don't give much significance to all the open structures, wires, pilot, etc.

Increased camber. Based on diagrams of the plane, the original value of 0.05 seems a bit too symmetrical.
Decreased stall AoA and reduced stall peak slightly to reflect an early, less efficient airfoil. The plane will stall around 11 degrees AoA. stalls are abrupt, but wing drop is actually not that bad with these settings.
Added an effectiveness attribute for all surfaces. Effectiveness is a misnomer for a value that actually increases the non-induced drag of a surface. I rarely use it, but given the crude wings and all the rigging, this seems reasonable here.
Elevator authority, CG, approach AoA etc. all configured to allow it to be brought barely to a full power stall. In some power-off situations it may not stall but will float downwards instead, which may not be wrong. It will stall easily in sharp turns though.

Moment might be a bit high, but I don't know the prop assembly weight so I left it alone.
I greatly reduced engine power. The original configuration was massively over-powered by YASim standards. The engine rating may be 50 HP, but the likely prop-engine output is not going to be like a modern engine, which YASim assumes. By considerably reducing power, I get a better solution and a flight that feels more realistic rather than over-powered. It likely needs tweaking by someone more familiar with these planes and this engine-prop combo, but beware of over-powering it.

Essentially I played with ballast to keep the CG slightly ahead of wing mid-chord. No idea where the true CG should be. -->
